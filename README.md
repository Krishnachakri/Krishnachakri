- 👋 Hi, I’m @Krishnachakri
- 👀 I’m interested in coding!! It's not about the term 'coding' but I am quite enthusiastic about coding..
- Listening to it many times, I had a great interest. With the interest, I tried to learn , code and got some experience on Front End Web Development i.e, HTML5 and CSS3. First I developed static websites which made me think that it's easy to code in Frontend. But later, I learnt about the responsive web designing using the JAVASCRIPT. And the process became interesting after learning the DOM Manipulations. Finally , I'm developing a responsive website. Also forgot to mention that I learnt python to have some good knowledge in any of the programming language and obviously chose PYTHON because of it's benefits and functionality present. Also In my academics I learnt JAVA and C programming languages
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about responsive web development by Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on hand-made projects on Python.
